In this session, you will be tackling some easy CTF challenges, with the help and guidance of our committee members.
<!--more-->
(and possibly more experienced Society Members).

We'll show you the types of challenges you can expect to see in a CTF, how to tackle them, and what to look out for.

This session is aimed at beginners, so you don't need to know a programming language, but it would be very helpful.\
Please do bring a laptop, if you have one. We'll try to supply a couple of them, and group people together, but can't make any guarantees.
