Welcome to a hybrid, on-/off-line Scavenger Hunt event, run in collaboration with RoboSoc (ICRS).
<!--more-->
We'll be intertwining the mechanical and physical prowess of RoboSoc with the digital and mental prowess of CyberSoc to have you engage in a test of wit (and patience) as you race to complete our trial of 6 challenges.

The Scavenger Hunt began at 10:00 sharp on Wednesday 9th October, when we released the whereabouts of Challenge 1:
>Challenge 1 will be a physical challenge taking place on South Kensington campus, multiple posters have been put up around campus, deciphering those posters will be your first challenge.

If you choose to accept our Challenge(s), you will have until 17:00 on Wednesday 16th October to complete all 6 challenges.

Good luck, Challengers \:)

Should you be really struggling with or find a problem with any of our challenges, please send us an email [here](mailto:fssh-help@iccybersoc.org).
