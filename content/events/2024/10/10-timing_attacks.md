Checking the time can be a powerful strategy to leak information from even the most secure systems.
<!--more-->

In this workshop, we'll help you design an attack on a simple password-checking system, and later we'll show you how to design a secure password-checking method.

This workshop is aimed at beginners, so no prior coding knowledge is assumed, but would probably help.\
If you have a laptop to bring, it would be helpful for the groupwork in stage 2, but not necessary.
