What do you want to see from the society? This is an opportunity to voice your opinions and discuss ideas. (Date and Time TBC, 03/12 just looks most popular rn)

Not much to elaborate on. There'll be some Committee Members and some Society Members, just chatting about the what and the how of CyberSoc in 2025.

Look forward to seeing you there :)

And if you can't make it, it would be amazing if you could fill in [this short form](https://forms.gle/2eWmtC1gFZQvJrSg9), whenever you can, to let us know your opinion.
