How safe is your self-driving car?

<!--more-->

This talk, delivered by Emily, will detail the mechanisms behind how Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) work, focussing on their sensors.\
Before then detailing the ways in which these sensors can be exploited to 'mess with' the CAV.

Members of all levels are welcome, with a bit of prior knowledge on what an autonomous vehicle is, being helpful.
