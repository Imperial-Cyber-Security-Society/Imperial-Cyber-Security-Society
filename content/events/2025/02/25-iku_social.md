A chill quiz social (and optional barnight to follow) with our UCL and KCL sibling societies.

If you've been waiting for the chance to showcase your Cybersecurity knowledge, learn more about Cybersecurity, or just to meet other people, this is your chance!

The event location has yet to be decided, but will likely take place on UCL's [Bloomsbury Campus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FLwsGCVNfe5DzG6b7), with the following barnight going from 18:00 to whenever your social battery expires.

This'll be a great opportunity to get to know some students from other London universities, who you'll probably see again in future collabs :)

Closest Station is Russell Square, which is on the Piccadilly line (~8 stops from South Kensington).
