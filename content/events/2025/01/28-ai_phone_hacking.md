In this informal brainstorming/discussion session, a couple starter ideas will be presented, before the question is then be opened up to the floor, for brainstorming of more ideas :D

Please come along for a fun, creative session, where we explore the more creative aspects of applied cybersecurity.

This is a completely open event, accessible to anyone regardless of technical level, because anyone can contribute ideas :)\
This will be an open-floor discussion, but the exact style is amenable (by popular vote) on the day.
